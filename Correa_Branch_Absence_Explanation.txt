Hi Team, 

I recently ran into some legal troubles of my own due to personal reasons. Essentially, the hospital is classifying it as defensive psychological ideation. Please keep my branch in this group. 

Northwestern is reveiwing the policy code of conduct to see if I can still stay in the course. 

Therefore, please keep my branch. I will still work on my part of the project. 

Regards, 

Ismael Correa
